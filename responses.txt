The accuracy plot shown in Figure 4 of the Pythia paper has increasing accuracy from 4a to 4d as 
the amount of parameters increases. Similarly, we saw a decrease in loss plotted against an increase
in the number of parameters in the Pythia models. We can conclude that the greater the number of parameters,
the better the model performs (appears to be non-linear). 

The plot that results from plot_loss.py follows the same pattern as Figure 3a in the
Chinchilla paper. It matches because as the number of parameters increases,
the loss decreases in a non-linear form.

From both the Pythia and Chinchilla paper, it can be concluded that increasing the number
of parameters increases the accuracy and decreases the loss when evaluating the models.
